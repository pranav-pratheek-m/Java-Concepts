Just like how a manager of a sports team  knows the roles,scopes,strengths and weaknesses of his players well and trains them accordingly to produce accurate and best results,
 a programmer should know the functionalities,scopes and limitations of different components of development and program execution to write manageable code and produce efficient applications.
e.g. compiler can only check the code for compile time errors
     Runtime environment chwcks the code for runtime time errors and exceptions.This is outside the scope of the compiler.
